          <h3 id="currency">Currency</h3>
          <p>
          Japanese currency is the (Japanese) yen, abbreviated JPY. For 1 EUR you get approximately 165 yen. Foreign exchange can be performed at banks, larger post offices and ATMs at airports. Credit cards (Visa and Matrercard) are accepted at major stores, shops, and restaurants, but there are also many places that only accept payment in cash.
          </p>
          <h3 id="electricity">Electricity</h3>
          <p>100 V, 60 Hz (in Fukuoka). Plugs of type A.</p>
          <h3 id="tap-water">Tap water</h3>
          <p>Tap water is safe to drink.</p>
          <h3 id="tipping">Tipping</h3>
          <p>Service charges are always included in the final price, so there is no need to tip separately.</p>
          <h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>
          <p>The streets in Fukuoka city are usually safe. You should however exercise standard caution, as you would do in any large city especially around the very crowded areas. In the case of an emergency, dial the all-purpose emergency number 110 (for police office).</p>
          <h3 id="language">Language</h3>
          <p>Most people speak English to some degree. All shops/restaurants in Paris city centre should have someone with decent English.</p>

          <h3 id="transport">Public transportation</h3>
          <p>
          Subway: We recommend using the subway to get around in the city of Fukuoka. There are several variants of the tickets for the FUKUOKA CITY SUBWAY

(see <a href="https://subway.city.fukuoka.lg.jp/eng/">here</a> for more information).
          </br>
          You can take the Fukuoka city subway with your contactless credit card, for a maximum of 640 yen per day. This is probably the easiest and simplest way to use the subway: <a href="https://subway.city.fukuoka.lg.jp/topics/detail.php?id=1895">https://subway.city.fukuoka.lg.jp/topics/detail.php?id=1895</a>
          (the site is Japanese only but you can read it by translating it to English or to your language)
          </br>
          Bus: The buses in the city of Fukuoka are operated by 
          <a href="https://www.nishitetsu.jp/en/">Nishitestu Bus</a>. In most of its routes, buses require payment by pre-charged transportation card, mobile app, or cash. Contactless credit card payment is accepted only on limited bus routes. 
          </br>
          For cash payment for a bus ride, note that the driver does not give you change, so you need to prepare a precise amount of money for your bus fare. There is an exchange machine in front of the bus (it accepts 1000 yen bills and 500 yen coins only). When you get on to the bus, take a small paper note showing the number of your bus stop, and pay in cash with the paper note when you get off.
          </br>
          For transportation card and mobile payment for a bus ride, the following website has detailed information. Tap your card/phone when you get on to the bus from the middle door, and tap again when you get off from the front door. You can use the same transportation card and mobile payment app for the subway and local trains as well: <a href="https://blog.gaijinpot.com/how-to-use-a-mobile-ic-app/">https://blog.gaijinpot.com/how-to-use-a-mobile-ic-app/</a>

          </p>
          <h3 id=“climate">Climate</h3>
          <p>End of June in almost all of Japan is in the middle of the rainy season, and it can become quite hot and very humid. However, some occasional sunny spells can be had at times (we do hope so!). In any case, it might be a good idea to have your folding unbrella or a water resistant coat with you.</p>
          <h3 id=“todo”>Things to do</h3>
